// To run c language we have 2 type of process

//1. Compiling

//compile means convertion our code to binary

//for compiling c code we have to build the code fast for build c code
//we have to give a comment into our terminal
//commend: gcc (file name.c) -o (nickname)

//then we can execute the code

//2.Executing

/** Every program when we run its have some step 
 * 1. Editing - right the code
 * 2.compiling - conver to mesine code 
 * 3.linking - computer do that 
 * 4.executing - run the compiled file
